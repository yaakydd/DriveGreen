Project Title: Predicting Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Vehicles Using Machine Learning

BACKGROUND : 
The climatic changes is affecting the lives of most people in underdeveloped countries as well as more developed countries in the world. One of the factors contributing to climate change is vehicle carbon emissions.

Business Case and Requirements:
1. To predict carbon dioxide emissions using static vehicle features such as fuel type, engine size and number of cylinders.
2. To compare and evaluate the performance of six key models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors,Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost
3. TO save and use the best model after evaluation to predict the emissions
